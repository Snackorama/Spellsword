*Names that are bold are placeholders*

## Story/Plot

* The **Shattered Tower** awakens once more as the great **Archmage Shario** releases his powers into the tower,
creating an apocolapse that could end the world.

* Young **Jimmy** the SpellSword is recruited by the lords and queens to venture into the tower to destroy the Archmage.

* He has also brought a few friends to help him while delving into the tower. **Fahr** the lore master, **Kainya** the enchantress,
**Havar** the blacksmith, **Jai** the mage, and the Reaper himself.

## Game Mechanics

* The currency, Crystals will be used as a global currency used for any purchase made in the game. They can be used with any of shopkeeps at base camp and a few NPCs inside the tower. Crystals can be obtained by killing enemies, bosses or destructables.

* Glyphs can be found in chests, while fighting bosses or someotherways. They can be used at the enchantress to imbue your weapons with diffrent abilities.

* You may find recipies for armor, weapons, and magic in chests, bosses, or destructables.

* Base camp will be the main hub, where your character can customize weapons, and spells. This is where most of your crystals will go. 
At base camp you will have a few shop keeps. 

* The loremaster will record the enimies you fight down. After killing a certain amount of that enemy you can spend crystals to learn more about the enemy and gain will gain extra bonuses when fighting them. 

* The enchantress can take your glyphs and apply them to your weapons and armor. Depending on the amount of glyphs and power of them the crystal cost differs. For example **Blade Slash** glyph will allow your sword to shoot a projectile everytime you attack.

* The blacksmith will allow you to make new weapons and armor. Diffrent weapons will allow for diffrent fighting styles. Some of the weapons and armor may require glyphs to infuse them. Armor can also come in sets. For example the **Flame Lord** set can your enemies on fire when you walk into them. The **Flame Lord** sword may also ignite enemies with slow dammaging attacks.

* At the mage you can  equip up to three spells. Two of them being deffensive/offensive and one mobility spell. They cost
diffrent amounts of crystals to research and may take time to research. An example deffence spell could be **Ice Armor** that creates a deffensive barrier around you that prevents some dammage. **Fire Ball** could be an offensive spell where you throw a projectile that explodes on impact. **Phase** could be a mobility spell that allows you to teleport short distances.

* The reaper is the one that revives you when you die. When you die you keep all of your items and crystals you obtained. He will asist you by defeating a few enemies for a cost.

* When you enter the tower you explore it looking for the boss for the level. Once you destroy the boss it will give you three choices on certain perks that you lose once you die. After you defeat them you may teleport to the next area.
